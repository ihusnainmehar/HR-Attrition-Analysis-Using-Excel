# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Using-Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand the factors influencing employee attrition within an organization. Employee attrition refers to the rate at which employees leave the company, and understanding its root causes is crucial for retaining talent, reducing turnover costs, and improving employee satisfaction. The data set includes various employee attributes, such as demographics, job roles, education, and work experience, which are explored to provide actionable insights into attrition trends.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a critical concern for many organizations, as it impacts productivity, morale, and financial costs. The objective of this project is to identify key factors contributing to attrition and provide insights that can help the organization reduce employee turnover. Specifically, the project seeks to answer:
- What are the main factors contributing to employee attrition?
- Are there specific employee segments that are more likely to leave?
- How do work-life balance, job satisfaction, and compensation influence the decision to leave?

## Data Structure
The Dataset consists of a total of 1,470 entries with 35 columns about employee records, including attributes such as age, attrition status, business travel, daily rate, department, education, job role, and work-life balance, demographic details, job satisfaction, and performance metrics.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using **Excel**. The dataset contains information on various employee characteristics, including age, education, business travel, salary, years at the company, job role, and work-life balance. The following steps were taken to analyze the data:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation with Power Query
- Exploratory Data Analysis using Power Pivot and Dax measures
- Correlation analysis was used to identify relationships between attrition and other factors like distance from home, years at the company, and job satisfaction.
- Data Visualisation - created interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present the findings and insights. These dashboards made it easier to communicate the results to stakeholders and highlight key factors contributing to employee attrition.

## Key Insights and Findings:
**Here are a few insights that were discovered:**
- Employees with lower salaries are more likely to leave, especially when combined with low job satisfaction and limited growth opportunities.
- Employees in the age group of 18-24 with less work experience (often 0-5 years) showed the highest attrition rate likely due to career exploration, seeking better opportunities, desire for flexibility or educational pursuits.
- Low work-life balance and job satisfaction are significant factors contributing to employee attrition.
- The Sales and Research & Development departments had higher attrition rates, with Sales seeing more turnover due to the high-pressure nature of the job, and Research & Development due to dissatisfaction with growth opportunities.
- Frequent business travel often leads to higher turnover rates.
- Employees with fewer than 5 years at the company had a higher propensity to leave, indicating a need for early engagement and retention strategies. New hires may feel disconnected or dissatisfied early in their tenure if expectations arenâ€™t met.

## Recommendations:
- **Revisit Compensation Structures:** The analysis revealed that salary dissatisfaction is a strong predictor of attrition. Competitive compensation packages can help reduce turnover and increase employee loyalty.
- **Enhance Career Development Opportunities:** The data indicates that employees in the early-career stage (18 - 24 years) with entry work experience are more prone to attrition. Offering career development programs, mentorship, and clear advancement paths could help retain this key demographic.
- **Promote Work-Life Balance:** Since poor work-life balance is a significant factor contributing to attrition, the organization should explore flexible work options, such as remote working or flexible hours. Reducing travel for business or offering compensatory benefits for frequent travelers could also mitigate attrition.
- **Focus on Employee Engagement:** Early intervention is necessary for employees with fewer than five years of experience in the company. Initiatives like onboarding programs, regular check-ins, and targeted development plans can increase job satisfaction and retention in the early years.
- **Strengthen Manager-Employee Relationships:** Employees with positive relationships with their managers are less likely to leave. Training managers in leadership and communication skills can help them build stronger, trust-based relationships with their teams.
- **Regular Employee Feedback:** Implement regular employee surveys and feedback sessions to gauge job satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Actively respond to employee concerns and suggestions to create a more positive work environment
- **Targeted Retention Strategies for High-Turnover Departments:** Develop specific retention strategies for departments with high attrition rates, like Sales and Research & Development. This could include stress management resources for Sales employees and opportunities for collaborative projects in Research & Development.
- **Recognition and Rewards Programs:** Create recognition programs to celebrate employee achievements and contributions. Acknowledging hard work can boost morale and reduce turnover, particularly for younger employees who value appreciation.

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can create a more supportive and engaging work environment, ultimately reducing attrition rates and enhancing employee satisfaction.
